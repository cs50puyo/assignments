    "\n",
    "2. Do not forget to follow the coding styles that we have discussed previously, and from now on. You won't be warned specifically about these mistakes, but your card will contain a comment asking for style changes, and the card will be moved to the DOING list.\n",

    "3. Organize your time and avoid procrastinating. Remember that if you run into trouble you could use your assignment free penalties to postpone a deadline. Getting together to postpone an assignment is neither the way to solve problems, nor a demonstration of teamwork. Rules have been set since the beginning, and you were clearly told to plan ahead."
